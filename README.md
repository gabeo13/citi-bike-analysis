## Background & Challenge

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

The goal of this project is to aggregate the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and design a management quality report structure including static and interactive dashboard visualizations.
